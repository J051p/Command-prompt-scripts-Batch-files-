# Command-prompt-scripts-Batch-files-
List of tested (Windows 10) command prompt scripts (Batch files).
CMD script or Batch script is simply a text file (use Notepad or Notepad++) saved with .bat extension (or .cmd). Less powerful than PowerShell or Bash script. Syntax is pretty much the same, write down as much as possible commands and they will be executed one by one (this is only for simple batch scripts). To execute batch script, just double click on it, command prompt window will open and executes all commands.
